# Linear_regression

few project on Linear regression with SKlearn for sale
L1 and L2 regularization, normalization, gradient descent


SBP (1st number in Blood pressure measurments) show more sensitiivty to hip size and age, 2nd BP number DBP (blood pressure when heart at rest), not as sensitive to age, bpi, body measurments

increasing the noise, or addinf noise as viariable in the data can increase R^2 artificially, L1 reg. is good for controlling that.
Direct method R^2 is matrix is inversable/feasible is best solution vs. gradient descent , but when matrix is bog, can't get inversion or finding analytical solution for weights not possible , the gradient descent is idea. if gradient can't be easility calculated Tensor flow can be used.

sometime adding L2 regularization id outliers are not too far from main population is not useful, blood pressure study
